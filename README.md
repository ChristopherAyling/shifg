# Game

```bash
zig build run
```

RPG/DnD/Baldurs gate kind of game.

Tile based like pokemon.

Story based. Maybe based on left hand of darkness? Icy, hearths, politics/shifgrethor mechanic?

Ok I want to make something quicker.

Dungeon crawler type thing. Enemies you must defeat in word duels. Some you must intimidate. some you must please. some you must get some information from to finish the level.

alternatively, what if each one gave some kind of cryptic crossword clue?
